# Mira - A Complete Personal Productivity Tool

I built this application as a part of my learning project for Django. In the course of the duration, I stumbled up many Personal Productivity resources and the methods to build successful habits.

I decided to build this portal to apply my knowledge on the various technologies and productivity resources I've learned upon.

## Installation

```
pip install -r requirements.txt

python manage.py createsuperuser

python manage.py runserver 

```

And that's it. You can run your own productivity tool for your own use.
