# Mira - A Complete Personal Productivity Tool

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rohan-krishna/mira.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rohan-krishna/mira)

I built this application as a part of my learning project for Django. In the course of the duration, I stumbled upon many Personal Productivity resources and the methods to build successful habits.

I decided to build this portal to apply my knowledge on the various technologies and productivity resources I've learned.

## Installation

```
pip install -r requirements.txt

python manage.py migrate

python manage.py createsuperuser

python manage.py runserver 

```

And that's it. You can run your own productivity tool.
